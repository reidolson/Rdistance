#
#   Compute the uniform likelihood, scaled appropriately, for all distance values in dist.
#
#   The likelihood is actually a "heavy-side" function of the form,
#
#       f(x; a,b) = 1 - 1 / (1 + exp(-b*(x-a))) = exp( -b*(x-a) ) / (1 + exp( -b*(x-a) ))
#
#   which you can see is basically a logistic function.  Parameter a is the location of the
#   "discontinuity" (=inversef(.5) = a) and b is the "knee" or sharpness of the knee at a.
#
#   Input:
#   a = parameter values. Length and meaning depend on series and expansions. If
#       no expansion terms called for (ie., straight logistic) a is
#       length 2, where a[1] is upper end of support (i.e., density is approximately U[0,a]),
#       and a[2] is sharpness of the decline (or knee) at a[1]
#       If expansions are called for a[3:length(a)] are coefficients of the
#       expansion.
#   dist = input observed distance data
#   w = right truncation value, same units as dist
#   series = character values specifying type of expansion.  Currently only
#       "cosine" and "simple" work. Default is no series expansions.
#   expansions = number of expansion terms.  This controls whether series
#       expansion terms are fitted. Default = 0 does not fit any terms.
#       If >0, fit the number of expansion terms specified of the type
#       specified by series.  Max terms depends on series.
#   scale = logical, whether or not to scale the likelihood values so
#       that the underlying density integrates to 1. This parameter is used
#       to stop the recursion.
#
#   Output:
#   A vector same length as dist, containing likelihood values, scaled appropriately.
#   Likelihood for all distances >w are set to NA
